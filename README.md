<details>
  <summary>PHPStan - PHP Static Analysis Tool</summary>
  
  [phpstan/phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
  > PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code. It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the sense that the correctness of each line of the code can be checked before you run the actual line.
  
  ```bash
  $ composer phpstan
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>PHPUnit</summary>
    
  [sebastianbergmann/phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) | [Writing Tests](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.3/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html)
  > PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
  
  Run tests:
  ```bash
  $ composer phpunit
  ```
  
  Code coverage
  ```bash
  $ composer coverage
  ```
  Will show results in console and if success, then generate `build/coverage/html/` directory (see `index.html` in browser) and `build/coverage/clover.xml` (which can be useful in some cases).

  <summary>Infection - Mutation Testing framework</summary>
  
  [infection/infection](https://github.com/infection/infection)
  > Infection is a PHP mutation testing framework based on AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) mutations. It works as a CLI tool and can be executed from your projectâ€™s root.
  >
  > Mutation testing is a testing methodology that involves modifying a program in small ways and analyzing reactions of the test suite on these modifications. If tests pass after the code is changed, then we have either not covered line of code or the tests are not very efficient for the mutated piece of code.
    
  ```bash
  $ composer infection
  ```
